#summary Utility class used to turn any object into a singleton.

= Introduction =
The SingletonFactory can be used to turn any object in your application into a singleton. A singleton is a pattern that restricts the instantiation of an object to one instance.  Using this factory only one object will be created per Class Type.  However, outside of the factory, there is no restriction or control.  Below we will detail the working of the class.


= Creating an Singleton Instance =
To create a singleton instance, pass a class type into the 	
getSingletonInstance method. If the instance has not already been created, the factory will create the instance and store it in a key/value table, otherwise the instance will be looked up and returned.
