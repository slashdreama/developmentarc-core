#summary The Selection Management system enables any kind of object to become selectable and treated as part of a group similar to a Flex's RadioButtonGroup.

= Introduction =

The Selection Management system provides a way to make any object selectable and part of a selectable group (similar to the RadioGroupButton).  By implementing a simple interface ISelectable which exposes a single property "selected", a developer can make any object in its code base a selectable item.  By adding an instance of the ISelectable item to a selectable group, we can great a set of objects that behavior as one would expect a RadioButton.  When an item is selected, all other items in the group are unselected.  There are two ways to use the Selection Management system to control groups of selectable items.  The first to leverage the system's controller class SelectionController,which provides developer the most control in selecting and unselecting items.  However, this approach requires more custom code that might necessarily be needed.   To provide a more out of box solution, a SelectionGroup class is available for developer to leverage to encapsulate the common code a typical group would use to select and unselect items.   Below we will explore how to create a ISelectable item and how to utilize the both grouping systems.
