The !HashTable is a key/value pair data structure for use in all !ActionScript 3 / Flash Platform applications.

= Introduction =

The !HashTable is an !ActionScript 3.0 data structure that is not dependent on any of the Flex SDK, this means you can use it freely in both Flash, AIR and Flex projects. The !HashTable, simply put, is two Arrays which are wrapped in logic to provide a simplified data access API for development. Its not complex, but it can cut out a ton of code that you would typically write over and over.
